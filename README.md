QArantine is a multi-purpose QA automation tool that aims to facilitate the QA work during the development of applications (mainly focused on video games) in C#.

Note: I'm developing this project coupled to a private videogame project with more collaborators, so I just copy the progress here when I reach certain milestones. This is not the main repository where I develop the project, but a sample of the code. QArantine needs a project to be coupled to take advantage of most features.

As a preview, this is how the GUI of some QArantine functionalities looks like when running:

Log System and var tracker:

(Yes, the player is on the ground, that is indeed a bug in the game. Thanks QArantine <3)

Performance profiler:

Among other functionalities implemented so far, such as:
- A TestFramework to develop automatic tests to test the game autonomously.
- A multi-project Launcher to make and test builds, and visualize the outputs.
